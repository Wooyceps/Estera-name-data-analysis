# *Estera* name data analysis

## Description

The`main.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains an analysis of the frequency of the name 'Estera' across the country of Poland in the years 2000 - 2023, and also across different regions from 2019 to 2023. 

This project was created as a part of my data science learning journey.

## Context

The data used in this analysis is downloaded from open source polish government page [dane.gov.pl](https://dane.gov.pl/pl/dataset/219,imiona-nadawane-dzieciom-w-polsce?page=1&per_page=20&q=&sort=-data_date&model=resources). It is in the form of a CSV files in `datasets` directory.

The idea was to analyze the popularity of my girlfriend's name in Poland. The name *Estera* is not very common in Poland, so it was interesting to see how its popularity changes over the years and across different regions.

## Features

- **Data Analysis:** The notebook includes code for analyzing the data to find the total occurrences of the name 'Estera' in each region for each year.

- **Data Visualization:** The notebook uses matplotlib to create bar plots for visualizing the percentage of the name 'Estera' given in each region for each year. The plots are organized in a grid of subplots for easy comparison.

- **Customization:** The code allows for easy customization of the plots, including setting the y-axis limits and labels.
